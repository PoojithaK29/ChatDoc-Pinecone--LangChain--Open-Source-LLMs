# ChatDoc-Pinecone--LangChain--Open-Source-LLMs
This project demonstrates the integration of advanced frameworks and open-source models to create a powerful document querying system. Using Pinecone for vector storage, LangChain for document handling, and Sentence Transformers for embeddings, this system showcases expertise in cutting-edge NLP techniques and scalable solutions.
## Key Components

- **Pinecone:** High-performance vector storage and similarity search.
- **LangChain:** Comprehensive document processing and splitting.
- **Sentence Transformers:** Open-source model for advanced semantic embeddings.
- **Open-Source LLMs:** Utilizes powerful language models for enhanced query understanding and response generation.
